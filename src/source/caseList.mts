These include that (1) the government and guards at the detention camp do not allow detainees to make phone calls, including by saying this is a terrorist prison and there is no capacity to make calls and by limiting available phones and times such that most people cannot use them; (2) unrepresented detainees transferred to Guantanamo do not have access to a legal directory, know your rights briefings, or practical means to meet counsel; and (3) retained counsel face numerous obstacles to representing their clients, including that only five detainees can make phone calls each day, there are no means for attorneys to initiate contact with their clients, and there is no way to transfer or sign paperwork other than the government's announced policy to generally follow the procedures used in the habeas litigation involving law of war detainees, and to transfer mail to detainees from Washington, D.C. on a weekly basis.
